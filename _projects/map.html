	This web map was created using qgis2Web and Leaflet to visualize data from Hayat and Fast (2019) on
	accessible mobility at the University of Calgary. It shows the percent of accessible
	entrances per building, the distribution and accessibility of street crossings (using curb ramps)
	as a proxy), accessibility of parking lots, and sidewalk and crosswalk accessibility.</p>
<p>
	To use the web map, pan and zoom in or out using the usual gestures on your device. Hover over features
	to view additional information (e.g. type of sidewalk barrier). Toggle layers on or off in the legend pane to
	only show features of interest. View the citation for the data source by hovering over the information icon. </p>
